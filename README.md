This is an implementation of the famous `printf` function that prints a string to `stdout` with the help of a format string that specifies the types of characters passed in as optional arguments.

### Prototype
```c
int _printf(const char *format, ...)
```

It returns the number of characters printed excluding the null character used to end the string.
